		The World Health Organization(WHO) has immense amounts of publicly available tabular data. This data can vary from poverty rates, and homicide rates to life expectancies by country. There is a lot of data, however on it’s own, in its raw form, it is very difficult to process thus making it not useful if not presented correctly. By downloading the data in it’s JSON format, we can then process it and turn it into a beautiful, easy to comprehend visual representation solving the problem at hand. 

		<br><br>
		<b>In summary, there is lot’s of good data left in raw tabular form, but by processing this and representing it visually using HTML+CSS and Javascript, it is easier to understand.</b>

		I chose the second design.

	<h3 class="header">Justification</h3>
	<p class="header" style="margin: auto;">
		Number one, it is more neat and aesthetically pleasing. At the top of the page, you immediately see the life expectancy of any given country of your choosing in a simple textual format. You can use the dropdown to choose the country and year. Then when you scroll down, you can see three visual representations of the life expectancy. These three are bar graph, line graph, and a map. These three are part of the canvas and are neatly organized at the bottom of the page, and are easy to understand providing the solution to the problem. There is also a button to scroll you down to the graphs making it very intuitive. I believe this design would also work very well on mobile because of the scrolling design. If the user wants to see the original tabular data, they can click on a link at the bottom of the page which shows the WHO’s website. This website is very well suited towards the target audience of high school students as it displays the data simply, ergonomically, and very fast. Another big plus is the simple animations I plan to add which add some visual flare to the product without distracting from the data. The baby growing old then dying directly relates to life expectancy. Finally, there is no struggle to find the information you are looking for. That is why I believe this is the best design for my product.
