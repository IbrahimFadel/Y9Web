	<h3 class="header" style="font-size: 25px;">Explanation & Justification</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header">Explanation</h4>
		<p class="sub-p">Today, data is being collected all the time. However it is not being used or presented effectively. With organizations such as the World Health Organization collecting data on many things such as Life Expectancy, it is important that we use it effectively. The problem is that this is all valuable information, but as it stands now, as tabular data it is ineffective and unuseful. This website will take this tabular data from the WHO’s website in the form of JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON for short and represent it in a beautiful way.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header">Justification</h4>
		<p class="sub-p">This process explained above is important to undergo for many reasons. Firstly, tabular data is next to useless. Humans were built to interpret visual data, not mathematical. So by employing the computer’s strengths(computing) we can take tabular data and spit it out in the form of visually appealing, easy to understand graphs and charts. This makes it easy to see trends, and draw conclusions. This representation of the data can help students doing research in these areas. Without this website, the data presented by the WHO is next to useless. The justification for the website is that it makes the data useful for users.</p>

	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header">Target Audience / Client</h4>
		<p class="sub-p">The target audience of my product is highschool students. These students in particular are going to be taking humanities courses that look at things like life expectancy, and analyze the statistics they find. My product could be a big help for these students. While the product is still useful to adults, the visual representation is more suited to teenagers. This product is right at the threshold of informative and easy to understand. This is why the target audience of my product is highschool students.</p>

		<p class="p">We are living in the age of data. Our data is being tracked everyday with every google search, and every video we watch. Yet with so much data being collected, we still sometimes find it difficult to truly understand it. With so many organizations like the 'World Health Organization' presenting this data in it's raw, tabular form, we can then transform it into a beautifilly visualized representation using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. By downloading the raw data from the WHO's website into JSON format, we can then process this data and present it on the HTML5 canvas element. This provides a more readable, understandable interface from which anybody can understand the given data. The problem with the way data is presented is that we are only looking at numbers. Humans were not built to process numbers. We were built to take in information with our five senses. When looking at these numbers, it's difficult to truly understand the issues, and trends presented in the data. By representing this tabular data in the canvas element, we can help people better understand the data they are looking at, making it easy for real progress to be made!</p>

	<h3 class="header" style="font-size: 25px;">Primary Research / Skills</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header">Skills Needed</h4>
		<p class="sub-p">The skills i will need to know are varying and in some cases, complicated. I must first be able to download the JSON and write a javascript program to read it, and get the raw data from it. Next I must use the raw data, and write some javascript to display it on an html canvas. The website shall have many different functionalities such as reversing the order of the list, ordering based on alphabetical, the data values, and finally displaying data from different years. These functions will all require javascript. However what’s often overlooked is the backbone of the website which is the HTML. This is the make or break of the website. Without it, the user cannot navigate click any buttons(because there are none), etc. Much of my time will be spent making the HTML. Finally an immense amount of CSS will be used. The user experience is extremely important. Without good styling of a website, the user is almost guaranteed to leave, as such, I will need profound skills in CSS.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header">Priority</h4>
		<p class="sub-p">The number one priority will definitely be the javascript code. This is for many reasons, but most importantly, it is the hardest code to write out of the three needed for this project. It will be the most time consuming, and also carries out the core functionality. Without the javascript, I would have to copy down each data point into a table by hand which is unrealistic. The next priority will be the html. This could arguably be the top priority, but since the javascript could display the data on the console without html, html will be second in priority. Without the html, we have no website. Merely a command line program which is still useful, but not in accordance with our goal which is to present an easy to use, read and understand representation of data. With html, we have access to the canvas tag which will allow us to display the data graphically without the use of extensions such as flash. Html also allows for buttons, and links, text and much more. Without it, this website could not exist which is why it is the second priority. Last but not least is CSS. While this is crucial to the website, it does not contribute to functionality, it ensures that the user stay on the website for the longest amount of time. With an ugly website, there is zero chance that a user will stay on for long which is why it is still a priority, but the last one.

	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header"><a href="https://worldpoverty.io/" target="_blank">World Poverty</a></h4>
		<p class="sub-p">The first product I analyzed is worldproverty.io. This website is a shining example of what mine aims to be. It is full of great examples of the canvas element. It presents very interesting data in a very interesting, engaging, and most importantly, simple manor. This allows for many demographics to use it for research and out of pure curiosity no matter the level of their education. Most importantly, the website is extremely interactive. You are able to select different settings, see different countries individual statistics. There is so much data being presented and it’s extremely easy to comprehend. These are important characteristics that I hope to include in my product. The website has an interactive map, where you can zoom, select countries, select the year you look at. These features all play together to make a successful product. This is mainly javascript and html, however I would like to point out that the css has been very well done. The fonts, and colours don’t conflict and are very aesthetically pleasing. The background is clean, and everything looks very nice. This definitely contributes to me staying on their website when doing research and not leaving straight away. All of these features would be very good to add to my product. However some are more realistic than others, for example, the map is more complicated than the check boxes. The only negative I’ve found on this product is that for some reason, the scrolling feels very unnatural and jerky. Overall, it has many pros and great features that I will look into including into my final product.

		<h4 class="header">Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Cool animations</li>
			<li>Lot’s going on</li>
			<li>Valuable data</li>
			<li>Easy to understand</li>
			<li>Multiple representations of the data(map, number/percentages)</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="header">Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Wonky scrolling</li>
		</ul>
</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header"><a href="http://population.io/#/2004/11/24/male/Canada/home" target="_blank">Population</a></h4>
		<p class="sub-p">Right away when opening this website, we see an engaging display. It is a graphic/animation representing the global natural increase rate/ global birth rate.It shows you from which country that baby is from, and ‘hello’ in it’s language. As if this graphic wasn’t enough, there is also an extremely interesting feature where the user can enter it’s birth date, and where they are from, and get back their life expectancy. This is very applicable to my product. This means that I will look very closely at this product. Using a huge foundation of statistics and data, it shows so much different information in creative ways. Most importantly, it is super easy to understand, and read. There are many different things you can do like seeing the big milestones in my expected life time and which countries give birth to the most babies, and so much more. This product is filled to the brim with functionality, and it has inspired me to try to make my product as similar as possible. Of course many of these functionalities are unrealistic for my product, but some are achievable. Namely displaying the life expectancy in different counties. This website inspired me to do more research, and I found a resource called <a href="https://github.com/neveldo/jQuery-Mapael" target="_blank">Mapael</a>. This resource will allow me to make an interactive map which I can use to make my representation of the data, even more interesting and intuitive. Once again, this website shows exceptional use of CSS for it’s styling. There are smooth transitions, the fonts and colour schemes are good, and it’s aesthetically pleasing. I honestly see no negative aspects in this website and would like to include as many features as possible that are realistically achievable in my product.

		<h4 class="header">Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Great animations</li>
			<li>Valuable stats</li>
			<li>Visual queues</li>
			<li>Interactive(forms)</li>
			<li>Several representations of data</li>
			<li>Many statistics shown</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="header">Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Distracting/Intrusive links to their social media</li>
		</ul>

</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header"><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank</a></h4>
		<p class="sub-p">The first thing I noticed when I accessed this website, was that you needed to enter in what stat you wanted to see. I really liked this feature, however my product will only be tracking one stat, life expectancy. After you select your statistic, it presents you with a line graph. The user is also given the option to see a bar graph and a map. However, when I used the website, the map did not work. This is something that they need to work on. It is frustrating for a user to try to use something that doesn’t work, and they will most likely stop using your product. What I draw from this product, is that when creating the solution, I will make sure all buttons/features work. I liked the slider at the bottom of the screen that allowed you to change the year of the data. This is a more complicated way of changing the year than what I had planned, but after some research I found a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp" target="_blank">W3schools</a> resource that clearly explains how to implement this into my product. I will aim to use this method instead of radio buttons or a options list as it provides a much better user experience, and is much more aesthetically pleasing. Even though this website was not as complicated as the others I analyzed, it had much to offer, and had features that would be more realistic for me to implement into my product. It also contained a list of all countries with their stats listed in a more tabular format. Even though this isn’t a use of the canvas, it is interesting to contrast the tabular data to the graphs and visual representations, and if there is time, I will aim to include that feature into my product. One big flaw in this website is the time it takes to load. It takes way too long. Users will not usually wait that long for a product to load, so I will have to make sure my product improves in that aspect.</p>
	
		<h4 class="header">Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Presents lot’s of data</li>
			<li>Has professional looking graphs</li>
			<li>Multiple representations of data(line, bar, and map)</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="header">Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Took long time to load</li>
			<li>Unintuitive</li>
			<li>Not much visual flare</li>
		</ul>

	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h4 class="sub-header"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" target="_blank">Our World In Data</a></h4>
		<p class="sub-p">This product was arguably the best one I analyzed. It had a vast amount of graphs, and different representations of the data. Obviously, with the time and resources/knowledge I have available, I won’t be able to include as many graphs, and the graphs I do have, will probably not be as complicated. I really hope to use as many graphs as possible while maintaining simplicity to make sure the product still applies to the target audience. Above all, it cites all it’s sources which is very useful. The only problem I found when analyzing this product, was that there was no visual flare. The website focused more on presenting the data in graphs then explaining, and accommodating to the user’s need, thereby reducing the user experience. Another huge pro, was that most of the graphs and charts were interactive, These are all things that I would love to include in my product. Some are unrealistic given my skill and time available, but I will aim to include as many as possible.</p>


		<h4 class="header">Pros</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Lot’s of data</li>
			<li>Many different graphs</li>
			<li>Lot’s of representations of the data</li>
			<li>Highly interactive</li>
			<li>Cited sources</li>
			<li>Compares data from different years</li>
			<li>Colour coded</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="header">Cons</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Lacks visual flare</li>
			<li>More data than explanation</li>
		</ul>

	<h3 class="header" style="font-size: 25px;">Design Brief</h3>

	<p>After researching many products that were presenting data both tabularly and visually, I have decided to create my own product that takes some of the best aspects of each product I saw, and will try to exclude the negative aspects.</p>

	<br><br><br>

	<h4 class="header">My product will:</h4><br>

	<ul>
		<li>Show life expectancy of countries visually</li>
		<li>Be able to show data from selected years</li>
		<li>Be represented in different forms(line graph, bar graph, possibly map)</li>
		<li>Be aesthetically pleasing</li>
		<li>Load relatively quickly</li>
		<li>Have Customization(reverse order, change colours, etc.)</li>
		<li>Help educate on the topic</li>
		<li>Have a good user experience</li>
		<li>Be intuitive</li>
		<li>Have every button work properly(everything has a function)</li>
		<li>Have links to WHO’s data</li>
		<li>Provide highschool students easily accessible/understandable data</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 class="header">My research is valid because:</h4><br>

	<ul>
		<li>Looked at websites with friends/family</li>
			<li>All had same criticisms</li>
		<li>Websites looked at are credible</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 class="header">This is relevant because:</h4><br>

	<ul>
		<li>It solves the problem of tabular data being incomprehensible to most people</li>
	</ul>
